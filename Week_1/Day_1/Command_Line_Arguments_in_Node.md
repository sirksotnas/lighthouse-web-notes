### What are Command Line Arguments?

* are strings of text used to set configuration or property values for when an application run through [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI) of an operating system.

* Example:
```
$[runtime] [script_name] [argument-1 argument-2 argument-3 ... argument-n]
```

* runtime is a program/script that executes a program, separated by a space and can pass arguments in key-value pairs.

### Why Use Command Line Arguements?

* Passing information to an application before it starts is useful for large-scale configuration settings.

* String arguments can be easily converted to other data types, making them flexible.
